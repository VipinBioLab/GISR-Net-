# GoogLeNet-based image to scalar regressor for quality assessment of illumination correction in dermatological macro-images
This repository contains a task-based deep learning model named GoogLeNet-based image to scalar regressor network (GISR-Net) for quality assessment of the illumination-corrected macroscopic images with Matlab codes.

Download the DEMO_GISR-Net.zip file to run the demo code to get the no-reference image quality assessment (NRIQA) metrics named GoogLeNet illumination correction quality index (GICQI).
